## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing. Here's everything you'll need to make your first contribution.

### What can I help with?

We welcome contributions of all sorts. Even the most minor changes are warmly welcomed. You may choose to work on an existing issue or propose your own.

Some examples of contributions are:

1. Documentation: From spell corrections to documenting the necessary information, all comes in this section.

2. Bugs: Any bug fixes are counted in this section. If you see a new bug, feel free to create a new issue mentioning the problem faced.

3. Feature Requests: If you would like to see some new features around the website, you can always create a new issue mentioning the requested feature.

**Important:** Every PR must correspond to an issue. If there isn't an issue related to the PR, open a new issue in the Issues section.
